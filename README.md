Conway's Game of Life in Command Line Interface

Conway's Game of Life is a grid of cells that can be alive or dead. Each cell's next state depends on its 8 neighbors: a live cell stays alive with 2 or 3 neighbors, while a dead cell comes to life if it has exactly 3 neighbors. The grid updates in steps, and the pattern of alive and dead cells changes over time, creating different shapes and behaviors. Itâ€™s a simulation that evolves by following simple rules.
